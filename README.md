## üìå Problem Statement

The Brazilian e-commerce company is experiencing challenges in understanding customer satisfaction and sales trends across products, sellers, and regions. With large volumes of transaction, review, and delivery data, the company lacks a centralized and actionable view of business performance. There is a need to analyze sales patterns, identify top-performing categories and sellers, evaluate shipping delays, and uncover areas driving negative reviews.

This project aims to develop a Power BI dashboard using SQL for data preparation to help stakeholders make informed decisions, improve customer experience, and boost overall business efficiency.
